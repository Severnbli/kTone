# Decision log

## 2026-11-08 – MVP architecture

- **Decision:** Rust core (`core/`) with pitch detection (MPM) and music theory, exposed to the web via `wasm-bindgen` (`wasm/`). React + TypeScript + Vite PWA in `web/`. Docker Compose for the dev environment and the prototype.
- **Why:** one DSP/theory implementation reusable later in native apps; MPM is fast, accurate on voice and simple to implement without allocations.
- **Audio path:** `AudioWorklet` captures mic samples and posts them to the main thread; the main thread runs the WASM analyzer on 2048-sample frames with a 512-sample hop. Running WASM inside the worklet is a later optimization.
- **Alternatives:** YIN (similar quality, slightly more expensive), CREPE/SwiftF0 (more robust, much heavier – possible future option).
